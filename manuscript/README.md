# Figures and Latex source files for generating the manuscript

All the required files for generating the manuscript. The
figures in the folder `figures` are generated by the notebooks
in the `code` folder.

You may use the Latex editor [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html)
with the Latex distribution [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) to compile
the file `manuscript.tex` and generate the manuscript.

The manuscript text is not open source. The authors reserve the rights to the
article content, which is currently submitted for publication in the
[*Geoscientific Model Development (GMD)*](http://www.geoscientific-model-development.net/).
