## Abstract

A considerable amount of literature has been published on the magnetic 
modelling of uniformly magnetized ellipsoids since the second half of 
the nineteenth century. Ellipsoids have flexibility to represent a wide 
range of geometrical forms, are the only known bodies which can be 
uniformly magnetized in the presence of a uniform inducing field and 
are the only bodies for which the self-demagnetization can be treated 
analytically. This property makes ellipsoids particularly useful for 
modelling compact orebodies having high susceptibility. In this case, 
neglecting the self-demagnetization may strongly mislead the interpretation 
of these bodies by using magnetic methods. A number of previous studies 
consider that the self-demagnetization can be neglected for the case in 
which the geological body has an isotropic susceptibility lower than or 
equal to 0.1 SI. This limiting value, however, seems to be determined 
empirically and there has been no discussion about how this value was 
determined. Besides, the geoscientific community lacks an easy-to-use 
tool to simulate the magnetic field produced by uniformly magnetized 
ellipsoids. Here, we present an integrated review of the magnetic 
modelling of arbitrarily oriented triaxial, prolate and oblate 
ellipsoids. Our review includes ellipsoids with both induced and 
remanent magnetization, as well as with isotropic or anisotropic 
susceptibility. We also propose a 
way of determining the isotropic susceptibility above which the 
self-demagnetization must be taken into consideration. Tests with 
synthetic data validate our approach. Finally, we provide a set 
of routines to model the magnetic field produced 
by ellipsoids. The routines are written in Python language as 
part of the [Fatiando a Terra](http://www.fatiando.org/index.html),
which is an open-source library for modelling and inversion in geophysics.


## Reproducing the results

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
[git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/pinga-lab/magnetic-ellipsoid.git


All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in
the `code` folder. The sources for the manuscript text and figures are in `manuscript`.
See the `README.md` files in each directory for a full description.

The calculations and figure generation are all run inside
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
You can view a static (non-executable) version of the notebooks in the
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) webservice:

http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pinga-lab/magnetic-ellipsoid

See sections below for instructions on executing the code.


### Setting up your environment

You'll need a working Python **2.7** environment with all the standard
scientific packages installed (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc).  The easiest
(and recommended) way to get this is to download and install the
[Anaconda Python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads#all).
Make sure you get the **Python 2.7** version.

Use `conda` package manager (included in Anaconda) to create a
[virtual environment](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html) with
all the required packages installed.
Run the following command in this folder (where `environment.yml`
is located):

    conda env create

To activate the conda environment, run

    source activate ellipsoids

or, if you're on Windows,

    activate ellipsoids

This will enable the environment for your current terminal session.
After running the code, deactivate the environment with the following
commands:

    source deactivate

or, if you're on Windows,

    deactivate


**Windows users:** We recommend having a bash shell and the `make` installed
to run the code, produce the results and check the code. You may download the
[*Git for Windows*](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) and the 
[*Software Carpentry Windows Installer*](https://github.com/swcarpentry/windows-installer/releases).


### Running the code

To execute the code in the Jupyter notebooks, you must first start the
notebook server by going into the repository folder and running:

    jupyter notebook

Make sure you have the `conda` environment enabled first.

This will start the server and open your default web browser to the Jupyter
interface. In the page, go into the `code` folder and select the
notebook that you wish to view/run.

The notebook is divided cells (some have text while other have code).
Each cell can be executed using `Shift + Enter`.
Executing text cells does nothing and executing code cells runs the code
and produces it's output.
To execute the whole notebook, run all cells in order.
